## Project 2


####  Bop-it Online ineractive site
My idea for project 2 is for an interactive 'Bop-it' online game. To meet the project criteria, this needs to be an interactive site as well as incorporating user choice when it comes to the display of information, or to achieve their preferred goals.

## Technologies used:
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript

Bop it was a game popularised in the 90's as a boredom beater, whereby the user would be guided by audio to selectand engage with one of the 5 choices below.

  Bop it
  Flick it
  Twist it 
  Pull it
  Spin it 

The user had approximately 4/5 few seconds to make the correct choice or they lose the game. The time decreases the higher the score you attain thus increasing the difficulty of the game, and increasing the chance of human error. My interactive site will be built around the same principles of chance.

#### Elements I wish to include:

* Theme selector - potentially bright and light or dark mode
* Name input field prior to game kick off
* High score capture 
* High score dahsboard on main page.


## My iniital Brainstorm around this Project and idea flow:
-User enters usernmae
* Message appears - Hi usernmae, please hit start to begin or click here to view the rules. 
* Start Button - count down from 5
 * Onclick the computer selects at random from Bop it, twist it, flick it pull it and plays the corresponding audio.
* The user has 4 seconds to hit the corresponding button
* If the user hits the wrong button - Game Over displays with the score
* If the user makes the right choice it adds a point to the score and keeps looping until the user makes a wrong choice
* After 10 correct selections, the user has 3 seconds to make the right selection
* After 20 correct seclections, the user has 2 seconds
* After 30 correct selections the user has 1 second.
* If user achieves a high score it is saved to the Scoreboard with the username. 

#### UX
##  External user’s goal:

    The site’s users want to play an online game that has elements of chance.

##  Site owner's goal:

    The site’s goal is to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.

    
    
* Theme selector - potentially bright and light or dark mode
* Name input field prior to game kick off
* limited number of tries before the game is over
* high score capture 
* High score dahsboard on main page.


## Design
The colors I have chosen are once again in line with my personal minimalistic preference, and keeping in line with the Bop IT Branding colours.

#### Light Mode
Background: White
Font: Purple

#### Dark Mode
Background - Black 
Font - Yellow
Navigatin items , text etc white


#### Typography
The typography used throughout the site was specifically chosen as I felt it was a playful yet readable font, again tying in with the 


#### Images and Media
The images used for this project have been taken from the below sites:


The audio for the game was taken from the below website and was the audio from the original game created by Hasbro:

I drew inspiration heavily from the love Maths project completed as part of the course. I used this as almost a template or boiler plate for structural purposes.

Thank you to my wonderful mentor Martina, for her excellent and helpful insight. My focus from the outset was to ensure I hit the pass criteria, and Martina helped break this down for me into easier to manage chunks, without which i\ would have essentially allowed the scope to creep into a non plausable for delivery territory.

Thank you to Kasia Bogucka the cohort leader for her kind nature and dedication to ensure we all success at our

## Testing

The first round of testing ws physically checking for errors in the validators, which was completed on a daily basis was to run through the HTML and CSS validators to ensure there were no errors. I decided to do this daily to reduce the chance of introducing lots of errors in to my code which would take a long time to debug and resolve. This is one of the major lessons learned from my last project.
